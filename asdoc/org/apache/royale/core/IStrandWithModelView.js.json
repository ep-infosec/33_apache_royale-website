    "description": "The IStrandWithModelView interface is the basic interface for a host component for a set of plug-ins known as Beads where two of the plugins are a model and a view. In Royale, the recommended pattern is to break out optional functionality into small plug-ins that can be re-used in other components, or replaced with different implementations optimized for different things such as size, performance, advanced features, debugging, etc.  Beads are added to and removed from a Strand and can find and coordinate with other beads on the strand.",
