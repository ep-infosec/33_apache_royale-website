The Apache Royale community is pleased to announce the release of Apache Royale 0.9.4.

![](/img/blog/release-0.9.4.png)

The Apache Royale project is a continuation of the previous effort called FlexJS to produce a next-generation of the Apache Flex SDK that enables developers to use MXML and ActionScript to generate HTML/JS/CSS applications which can run natively in browsers. The cross-compiled code can also be used in Apache Cordova (Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications.

This release should be considered 'beta' quality. The purpose of this release is to gather feedback about the features and implementation strategies, and to recruit new contributors. We hope to grow the code base into an SDK and tool chain that deliver the highest productivity when developing applications that can run on many platforms. Beta releases may not handle production needs.

In 0.9.4 you can find important additions like a full new UI set called **Jewel** that's ready for production. This new set was designed with look and feel / themes in mind, so you can have a cool interface out of the box just using Jewel. Another great addition is bringing full **AMF/RemoteObject** support to Apache Royale so you can ease your migration from Apache Flex.

We are also working hard on MX and Spark **emulation** components that will help make your migration of an existing Apache Flex application a breeze. Many people are contributing to this effort, but more are welcome: please help us develop this powerful feature.

### Known Issues:

- Users only using Basic components and not MXRoyale or SparkRoyale emulation components should delete _frameworks/libs/MXRoyale.swc_, _frameworks/libs/SparkRoyale.swc_, _frameworks/js/libs/MXRoyaleJS.swc_, and _frameworks/js/libs/SparkRoyaleJS.swc_ from their library paths (or from the file system).
