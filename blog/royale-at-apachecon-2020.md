The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) held its annual convention, ApacheCon, September 29-October 1, 2020. Because of the pandemic, it was an all-virtual conference. Participants logged in and attended keynote speeches, track sessions, and informal hallway meetings from all around the world. The conference had a track in Mandarin, and sessions in Hindi.

**Attendance broke all previous records, with over three thousand people taking part.** Over 80% were attending their first-ever ASF convention.

There were 27 presentation tracks, the largest number ever for ApacheCon. Apache Royale was among them, with presenters in Pakistan, Spain, and Canada.

The tracks were:

- **Hello, Royale!**: A high-level tour of what Apache Royale does, its history, and what it offers to people creating new applications or migrating existing Flex applications before the end of Flash support.
